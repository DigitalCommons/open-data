  This is the first version using se-open-data with a schema.

  Comments are inferrences from the data.
  
  Descriptions are taken from:
    
  https://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/2021-09/Open%20Data%20Guide.pdf

  ## Sources of data
  
  The dataset is compiled from the following sources:
    - Annual returns submitted by registered societies to the
      Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)
    - Annual returns and accounts submitted by companies to
      Companies House. Data may come direct from Companies House
      or via an intermediary, such as Endole.
    - Statements of accounts published on organisations’ websites
    - Annual returns submitted by Co-operatives UK members
    - Department of Education data on school finances
    - Prudential Regulation Authority data on credit unions finances
    - From federal organisations and other collaborating organisations,
      including the Community Shares Unit and Co-operative College.
      
  Where possible the source of economic data is identified in the
  dataset. For some historical data, where this was not recorded, the
  dataset will identify the source as ‘Historical’.

  For a very small number of organisations the data we use in our
  published aggregate statistics is not openly available and we do not
  have permission to publish it. For example, unincorporated co-ops,
  whose accounts are not submitted to a registrar. In these cases we
  redact the entry from the dataset and include an aggregate total of
  all such data.

  ## Limitations of the dataset

  Co-operatives UK utilises many different sources of information and
  seeks to identify and monitor all co-operatives. As there is no
  single legal definition of a co-operative in the UK, we may not be
  aware of all co-operatives registered under different corporate
  forms. As a consequence, there may be some co-ops missing from the
  dataset.

  ### Dormant, dissolved and deregistered co-operatives
  
  Where a co-operative has voluntarily deregistered, this is included
  in the data alongside the date of removal from the register.
  
  Where a co-operative has been removed from the mutuals register by
  the FCA the deregistration date does not usually represent the date
  that the organisation ceased trading.  These are often the result of
  a purge of the register, causing misleading spikes in historical
  trends. To prevent this, these organisations are excluded from all
  years in the dataset.

  Where an organisation is shown as dormant by the registrar it is
  usually not possible to pinpoint when it ceased trading and so it is
  excluded from all years in the dataset.

  ### Comparison with previously published figures

  To maintain the accuracy and coverage of the dataset, Co-operatives
  UK constantly revises historical figures as new or more recent data
  becomes available. This may include adding or removing organisations
  from the dataset. If you are performing comparisons, it is
  recommended that you only compare within the same edition of the
  dataset. Comparisons between different editions of the dataset or
  with previously published data may distort time-series trends.

  ### Year of reporting
  
  The reporting year runs from 1st February to 31st January.
  
  Where organisational figures for a reporting year are not available,
  the data is substituted for the next most recent data. For example,
  if data for the 2018 financial year has not yet available, it would
  be substituted with 2017.

  There is a delay between an organisation’s financial year end and
  the data being published by the registrar. For the FCA this is up to
  7 months, for Companies House it is up to 9 months.

  desc: |
    The Sector Industry Classification code.
    
    Regarding this and related SIC fields: where possible,
    organisations are classified using UK 2007 standard industry
    classification codes. For convenience, the code is accompanied by
    the appropriate code description, with up to 5 levels of detail.
    
    The source of the classification code may be:
      - The most recent annual return or statement of accounts
        submitted to a registrar
      - Keyword analysis of the organisation name
      - Co-operatives UK knowledge of organisation

    Detailed information about UK SIC 2007 can be found at the Office
    for National Statistics:

  header: Sector - Simplified, High Level
  desc: |
    To complement the sector, which uses hierarchical SIC codes,
    Co-operatives UK produces a simplified, high level and
    non-hierarchical form of classification. It highlights areas most
    prominent in the co-operative sector and is subject to review and
    change over time.
    
    This classification is derived from the SIC code and contains the
    following categories:
      - Agriculture
      - Arts and Culture
      - Digital, Media and Communication
      - Education
      - Energy and Environment
      - Finance
      - Food service, Accommodation and Pubs
      - Health and Social Care
      - Housing
      - Manufacturing
      - Membership associations, social clubs and trade unions
      - None
      - Other
      - Professional and Legal services
      - Retail
      - Sports and Recreation
      - Transport
