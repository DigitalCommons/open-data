    To complement the sector, which uses hierarchical SIC codes,
    Co-operatives UK produces a simplified, high level and
    non-hierarchical form of classification. It highlights areas most
    prominent in the co-operative sector and is subject to review and
    change over time.
    
    This classification is derived from the SIC code and contains the
    following categories:
      - Agriculture
      - Arts and Culture
      - Digital, Media and Communication
      - Education
      - Energy and Environment
      - Finance
      - Food service, Accommodation and Pubs
      - Health and Social Care
      - Housing
      - Manufacturing
      - Membership associations, social clubs and trade unions
      - None
      - Other
      - Professional and Legal services
      - Retail
      - Sports and Recreation
      - Transport
