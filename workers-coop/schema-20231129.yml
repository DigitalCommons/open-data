    To complement the SIC sector, which uses hierarchical SIC codes,
    Co-operatives UK produces a simplified, high level and
    non-hierarchical form of classification. It highlights areas most
    prominent in the co-operative sector and is subject to review and
    change over time.

    This classification is derived from the SIC code. The Industry field uses the same taxonomy.
