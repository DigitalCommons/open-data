  This version has the country ID re-interpreted as the territory (in our sense)
  rather than the organisation's address (as it was being)
fields:
- id: :id
  header: Contact ID
  desc: 'A unique identifier for the organisation'
  comment: 'Typically a positive integer.'
- id: :name
  header: Organisation Name
  desc: "The organisation's preferred name"
  comment: 'The language is not currently defined. Character set assumed UTF-8.'
- id: :country
  header: Country
  desc: |-
    The country that the organisation's members' come from (as opposed
    to the country of the organisation's main address).  Should be an
    ISO-3166-1 "common name", using UTF-8, or 'International' if it is a
    supranational organisation. However, this field is now ignored,
    and the Country code field is used instead.
  comment: |-
    Note that the ISO-3166-1 common names change over time.
- id: :super_region
  header: Super-region
  desc: |-
    Identifies the super-region of the organisations' territory.
    Currently the English label of an super-region as defined by the ICA.
  comment: |-
    This needs to be merged with Region/Country fields, and mapped to
    a language-neutral identifier.
- id: :region
  header: Region
  desc: |-
    Identifies the region of the organisations' territory.
    Currently the English label of a region, as defined by the ICA.
  comment: |-
    This needs to be merged with Super-region/Country fields, and mapped to

    sanitisation recommended.
