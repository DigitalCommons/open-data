It was a member of the ICA from 1966 to 1993 when organisation was dissolved.

The formation of CAK was a response to the need by the Co-operative Movement to have a single voice in addressing its concerns on the national and international stage.

Also it has the role of collaboration, networking, representation, and the promotion of the growth and development of the Co-operative Movement.

CAK's vision is, ‘Every Kenyan is a co-operator’ which resonates with the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of ‘Leave No One Behind.’  Its mission is to articulate and promote the interests of the Co-operative movement locally and internationally for wealth creation and social development.
