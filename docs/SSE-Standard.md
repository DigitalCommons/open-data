# Description of Standard 
One of the early phases of the data processing pipeline involves converting the source data into an intermediary flat format, serialised as the Standard_Format.csv file.  

Once in this format the process of converting the data to rdf requires minimal further information from the user.

Here we describe the supported fields in this intermediary step before the data is transformed into RDF format.

Original_Data.csv/json/??? --(step 1)--> Standard_Format.csv --(step 2)--> RDF 

We also reference the rdf schemas to which we are converting the data.????

It is important to note that in the original data file fields do not have to map directly to the standard fields (although it is recommended). They can be composed by multiple fields, one field could describe two other fields, etc...

For example one could have the following fields in the Original_Data.csv: street address 1, street address 2. They would be merged into Street Address. Conversely one could have a field which maps to two fields in Standard_Format.csv: Country Street Address. This would be separated into two fields: Country, Street Address. More complex mappings and translations are also possible but it is recommended that a straightforward mapping is used (e.g. Country in Original_Data.csv maps directly to Country in Standard_Format.csv) since the margin for error increases with complexity.

# Field Definitions

## Identifier

    Required: Yes
    Description: A unique identifier used to identify each organization (initiative*) within a dataset. The uniqueness must be guaranteed within the passed dataset! (i.e. one must guarantee uniqueness within the passed Original_Data.csv file and the Standard_Format.csv file). The identifier will be used to create a URI address for the organization. (e.g. if Company XYZ passes an initiative with an id of IDENTITY, the resulting URI could be: data.solidarityeconomy.coop/XYZ/IDENTITY). These IDs must remain constant within the passed Original_Dataset.csv files
    Type: Text
